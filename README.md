OOP Project 

Create a C++ console application that allows user profile management within an application.  
Each user is identified by an unique ID.  

Requirements: 
- Define at least three classes related to the project requirements.  
- Implement at least one class that inherits from another class (demonstrating the "is-a" relationship).  
- Define an abstract class with at least one virtual function.  
- Include at least one dynamically allocated character string and one dynamically allocated array (vector) as attributes.  
- Implement one static attribute and one constant attribute.  
- Provide getters and setters for all class attributes.  
- Implement constructors and the assignment operator (`operator=`) for all classes.  
- Overload the `<<` and `>>` operators for each class.  
- Overload at least five operators from the following:  
  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `++` (postfix and prefix), `--` (postfix and prefix), `[]`, `()`, `!`.
